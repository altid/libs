We need to find a clean way to integrate libs/fs and server.
Essentials: 
 - exfiltrate data from fs about the state of the session
   - if we have a handle to the fs, inside of the server we would be able to call on and get the data out of the unit, while still using it identically to what we have now
 - Server type satisfies the interface fs expects

Wants: 
 - Remove much of the fs spinup code from existing services
 - We could pass a server generated by the server library back, with our same Handle/Run/etc files; and add one more method to get data out from the fs 

import (
	"github.com/altid/libs/server/ninep"
	"github.com/altid/libs/fs"
)

func main() {
	srv := ninep.Server(manager)
	ctrl, err := fs.New(srv, "feed", name, *debug)
