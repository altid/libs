Remove need for input:foo:message, just have input type and no weird fucking parsing
Remove Mock/Default, just use in-memory and toggle off logfiles for testing
Encrypt cache, etc?
Cleanup just cleans up our cache if we have to use it 
Listen or Start to run all the commands
ReadWriters instead of Readers and Writers
Create an input per client connect
 - Instead of having an input on the service like we have, attach it to the buffer and pass the handler over to it
 - This obviates the range and fuckiness around that
